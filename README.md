# Slidev Quiz demo

[Slides](https://jsbrittain.github.io/slidev-quiz/)

Experimental quiz application built with [Slidev](https://sli.dev). Requires a WebSocket server ([slidev-quiz-server](https://github.com/jsbrittain/slidev-quiz-server)) - navigate to that page for deployment status. If deploying elsewhere or locally, modify the url in `components/QuizPlayer.vue` and `components/QuizHost.vue`. Uses `pixi.js` for rendering.
