Experimental quiz application built with [Slidev](https://sli.dev), `pixi.js` and WebSockets. Requires a WebSocket server specified by the (build-time) environment variable `VITE_WS_URL` (localhost:8080 by default). The WebSocket server is available at [slidev-quiz-server](https://github.com/jsbrittain/slidev-quiz-server) - navigate to that page for deployment information.
