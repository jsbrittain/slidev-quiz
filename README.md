# Slidev Quiz demo

Experimental quiz application built with [Slidev](https://sli.dev). Requires a WebSocket server ([slidev-quiz-server](https://github.com/jsbrittain/slidev-quiz-server)) to be running (if deployed locally, otherwise the server should already be deployed, modify the url in `components/QuizPlayer.vue` and `components/QuizHost.vue` to customise). Uses `pixi.js` for rendering.
